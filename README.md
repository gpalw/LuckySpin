# 🎯 LuckySpin

> 🧩 Currently in active development — real-world tested in live events.

A web-based **Prize Wheel System** built with **Node.js** and **React**, designed for real-world marketing and event use.  
Operators can log in via tablet (e.g. iPad) to activate a prize wheel, spin multiple times, and track inventory automatically.  
The system has been successfully used in **offline promotional events** to manage on-site lucky draws and monitor prize inventory in real time.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Admin** creates a wheel and defines prize weights, messages, and stock.  
2. **Operator** logs in via tablet → Activates the wheel → Spins N times.  
3. Each draw:
   - Calculates the result server-side (cryptographically fair)
   - Deducts prize stock atomically
   - Records the result with a digital signature  
4. **Admin** can restock prizes or view statistics anytime.
